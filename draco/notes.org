#+TITLE: draco regular benchmarking

* How to build environment?

Since batch system may not schedule the job for a while, need to
select exact commits for all components that we care about (and
track).

If we do this on docker images that means building the images
elsewhere and then running in those images on draco.

Could also build inside the base image and save a new squash
filesystem before launching the runs (might be preferable?)

What do we care about exact commits of?

- [ ] UCX
- [ ] UCX-Py
- [ ] Dask-CUDA

What do we want to know the version of (entire environment probably,
via conda?)

- Build UCX-Py rdma docker file
- Install dask-cuda, cudf (can do this with appropriate environment file?)
